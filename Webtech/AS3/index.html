                    One of my recent research interests is the process of individuals’ access to creative goods or imaginary works— how we seek, appraise, and consume creative goods such as books, music, and movies for leisure. Unlike task-oriented information seeking, where the information sought functions as a means to answering a question, creative goods are consumed as the end in itself, for their hedonic or eudaimonic value. Furthermore, the consumption of creative goods tends to have a strong social element and is closely related to one’s social identity. Searching is ill-suited for access to creative goods because users’ needs are subjective and idiosyncratic and the meaning of creative goods is too rich and multi-layered to be sufficiently indexed. Chance-encounter, browsing, and recommendation are therefore much heavily relied upon in our access to creative goods. In the digital era, recommendation systems and e-WOM (Word-Of-Mouth) become popular means by which we come to be aware of, select, and appreciate a creative work. I have published on the topic of how individuals’ psychological traits such as openness to novelty-the degree to which one is willing to try previously unfamiliar works, and preference diversity-how heterogeneous one’s interests, might influence the effectiveness of different recommendation strategies. More recently, I have also become interested in how the narrative or information that frames a creative work might influence how it is perceived and experienced. Some example of external information includes the narrative accompanying a museum object, the program note of a piece of music, and the cover as well as reviews of a book.  Rarely do we acquire a creative work after we have experienced it in its entirety. The external information surrounding a work, therefore, serves as an important judgment cue to alleviate the uncertainty prior to its consumption. The external information and the context in which a work is presented also determine how much we are interested in it. More than judgment cue, how a creative work is represented also stimulates our interests and sometimes part task in our perception and enjoyment of it. It is therefore interesting to explore ways of representing a work that might pique our interest and enhance our enjoyment of a work.

                    The other aspect of my research is to apply social network analysis to the study of online and scholarly communities. In the context of scholarly communication, linkages among actors (authors) can be constructed based on citations of articles in their oeuvre. I’m especially interested in investigating how the similarity of authors’ research foci might influence their collaborating and citing behaviors. The similarity between a pair of authors’ research foci can be measured by the similarity of their research topics, as well as their bibliographic coupling and co-citation measures. A multiplex-networks can be constructed that consist of author topic similarity, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, co-author, and citation relationships. ERGM can then be used to test the relationships among these relationships.  The structural properties of these networks also help to make explicit the intellectual network of a scholarly community. These include the cohesion, centralization, and diversity of research areas in a knowledge domain.

                            The course is designed to provide an introduction to the use, design and evaluation of information (IR) systems. It covers major components in the IR process such as search strategies, indexing, IR models and IR evaluation. Students will also acquire hand-on experiences with IR evaluation and designing a digital library system. Special attention will be given to  the comparision  of  different  indexing  methods and IR models and how they might be complement each other.

                            The course is designed to explore various aspects of decision making in information consumption. To provide the students necessary analytic tools for user decision making, a survey of relevant literature in cognitive science, social psychology, HCI, and consumer behaviors will be given, with a special focus on their implications on explaining and predicting information users' decision making.
